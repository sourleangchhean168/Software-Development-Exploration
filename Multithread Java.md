Let's go through the code line by line:

1. `import java.util.Random;`: This line imports the `Random` class from the `java.util` package, which is used to generate random numbers.

3. `public class MatrixMultiplication {`: This line defines the start of the `MatrixMultiplication` class.

4. `static final int MAX = 1000;`: This line declares a constant variable `MAX` with a value of 1000, representing the maximum size of the matrices.

5. `static final int MAX_THREAD = 1000;`: This line declares a constant variable `MAX_THREAD` with a value of 1000, representing the maximum number of threads that will be used for matrix multiplication.

6. `static int[][] matA = new int[MAX][MAX];`: This line declares a static 2D integer array `matA` with dimensions `MAX` x `MAX` to represent the first matrix.

7. `static int[][] matB = new int[MAX][MAX];`: This line declares a static 2D integer array `matB` with dimensions `MAX` x `MAX` to represent the second matrix.

8. `static int[][] matC = new int[MAX][MAX];`: This line declares a static 2D integer array `matC` with dimensions `MAX` x `MAX` to store the result of the matrix multiplication.

9. `static int step_i = 0;`: This line declares a static integer variable `step_i` and initializes it with 0. It will be used to divide the work among multiple threads.

11. `static class Worker implements Runnable {`: This line defines an inner static class `Worker` which implements the `Runnable` interface. This class represents a worker thread that performs a portion of the matrix multiplication.

13. `int i;`: This line declares an instance variable `i` of type `int` in the `Worker` class.

15. `Worker(int i) {`: This line is the constructor of the `Worker` class, which takes an integer `i` as a parameter and assigns it to the instance variable `i`.

18. `public void run() {`: This line overrides the `run` method of the `Runnable` interface. It specifies the task that the worker thread will execute.

19. `for (int j = 0; j < MAX; j++) {`: This line starts a loop over the variable `j` from 0 to `MAX`, representing the columns of the matrices.

20. `for (int k = 0; k < MAX; k++) {`: This line starts a nested loop over the variable `k` from 0 to `MAX`, representing the common dimension of the matrices.

21. `matC[i][j] += matA[i][k] * matB[k][j];`: This line multiplies the corresponding elements of matrices `matA` and `matB` and accumulates the result in the corresponding element of matrix `matC` using the formula for matrix multiplication.

26. `public static void main(String[] args) {`: This line is the entry point of the program. It defines the `main` method.

28. `Random rand = new Random();`: This line creates an instance of the `Random` class called `rand`, which will be used to generate random numbers.

29. `long startTime = System.nanoTime();`: This line records the current time in nanoseconds as the start time for the matrix multiplication operation.

32-37: This block of code generates random values for the elements of matrices `matA` and `matB` using nested loops.

40-49: This block of code prints the elements of

 matrix `matA` in row-major order.

52-61: This block of code prints the elements of matrix `matB` in row-major order.

64. `Thread[] threads = new Thread[MAX_THREAD];`: This line declares an array of `Thread` objects called `threads` with a size of `MAX_THREAD`.

67-70: This block of code creates and starts multiple worker threads, each assigned a different portion of the matrix multiplication task. The `step_i` variable is used to divide the work among the threads.

73-78: This block of code waits for all the worker threads to complete their execution by using the `join` method to join each thread with the main thread.

81-90: This block of code prints the elements of matrix `matC`, which represents the result of the matrix multiplication.

93. `long endTime = System.nanoTime();`: This line records the current time in nanoseconds as the end time for the matrix multiplication operation.

95. `long timedone = endTime - startTime;`: This line calculates the elapsed time for the matrix multiplication operation by subtracting the start time from the end time.

96-97: These lines print the elapsed time in nanoseconds and convert it to seconds for better readability.

The code performs matrix multiplication by dividing the work among multiple threads to potentially improve performance. It generates random matrices, performs the multiplication, and prints the result along with the elapsed time.
